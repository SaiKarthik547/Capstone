# NeuroX - Multi-Disease Brain MRI Analysis System

## 📋 Project Overview

NeuroX is an advanced deep learning system for automated detection and segmentation of brain pathologies from MRI scans. The system simultaneously analyzes three critical neurological conditions: **Brain Tumors**, **Stroke**, and **Alzheimer's Disease** using state-of-the-art 3D convolutional neural networks with uncertainty quantification.

### Project Goal

To develop a clinically-viable AI diagnostic assistant that:
- Provides accurate multi-disease detection from a single MRI scan
- Generates precise 3D visualizations of brain pathology
- Quantifies diagnostic uncertainty for clinical decision support
- Meets publication-grade statistical rigor for medical AI research

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Disable Groq AI (offline mode)
export NEUROX_OFFLINE=true

# GPU selection
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

### Model Configuration

Edit `neurox_adaptive.py` (lines 94-98):

```python
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
ROI_SIZE = (96, 96, 96)
PRESENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5
MODEL_PATH = r"path/to/neurox_multihead_final.pth"
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### HD-BET Not Found

```bash
pip install HD-BET
hd-bet -h  # Verify installation
```

If HD-BET is unavailable, 3D visualization will be disabled (safe fallback).

### CUDA Out of Memory

Use CPU mode:
```python
DEVICE = torch.device("cpu")
```

Or reduce batch size in training script.

### Import Errors

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```
