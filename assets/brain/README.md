# Place Brain Atlas Files Here

After training on Kaggle, download the following files and place them here:

1. **lh_fsaverage.ply** - Left hemisphere brain mesh
2. **rh_fsaverage.ply** - Right hemisphere brain mesh

These files are required for 3D visualization during local inference.

## Where to get these files?
- From your Kaggle dataset: `/kaggle/input/brains/`
- Or download from FreeSurfer fsaverage

## File structure:
```
assets/brain/
├── lh_fsaverage.ply
└── rh_fsaverage.ply
```
