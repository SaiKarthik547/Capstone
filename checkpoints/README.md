# Place Trained Model Here

After training on Kaggle, download your trained model and place it here.

## File to place:
- **neurox_ultimate.pth** - Your trained model checkpoint

## How to get it:
1. Train model on Kaggle
2. Download the `.pth` file from notebook outputs
3. Place it in this `checkpoints/` directory

## Alternative:
You can also place the `.pth` file in the main neurox directory (same folder as neurox_adaptive.py).

The code will automatically find it in either location!
